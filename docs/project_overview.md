Taking Wing: Building an Agentic Bird Brain
You’re the brand-new owner of Betty’s Bird Boutique, a pet store that caters to people who are buying birds and all the food and accessories they may need. You don’t actually know much about birds, but you have always wanted to own a store, and the opportunity came up.

The Challenge
Unfortunately, the store's website is pretty basic. You want to enhance it by adding an AI agent to answer customer questions about birds in general and what your store offers.

A key requirement is that the agent should not take orders—the goal is to encourage customers to come into the store and establish a good relationship.

The Goal
You will build an agent that can answer questions about your store and birds based on information from three primary sources:

A price database stored in a relational database.
PDF or other text files containing information about your store, such as hours of operation and its history.
Web-sourced information for general questions about birds.
The agent must also have guardrails to avoid answering questions that are unrelated to birds or your store. Before deploying to a live website, you will test and refine the agent in a dedicated development environment.

Project Summary
Using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and a GCP runtime environment, you will build a simple customer support agent that answers questions topically relevant to your store. It should be able to carry on a multi-turn conversation, remembering facts from previous turns, but it does not need to store information from previous conversations.

The agent should have three tools that it is able to use:

Look up prices: Connect to a relational database to find the price of a specific item.

Answer store-specific questions: Use PDF documents as a knowledge base to answer questions about:

The store hours
The store location
The history of the store, the current staff, their birds, etc.
Answer general questions about birds: Use information from Google Search and the web.

The agent should also have guardrails, implemented through prompt engineering or tools, to avoid answering questions that are not related to birds or your store.

You will develop this project using a workspace where you can run the python script in the “adk web” testing environment. This will allow you to have conversations with your agent, providing a simulation of the customer experience along with valuable debugging feedback.
